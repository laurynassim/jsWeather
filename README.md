# Weather Showcase app

Weather app based on accuweather API.

Select language, units, enter your city location and hit search button.

There 9 different video backgrounds that load up depending on API response (cloudy, sunny, rain, etc.) Not very practical in terms of load time, but it was a fun idea to implement :)
